The testing harness (../../runall) doesn't run these files directly, but
instead through .mlb files in the parent directory. This is because the test
command is simply `smlfmt --preview-only`, which will fail on SuccessorML
features. But we can use a .mlb file to enable select features.

For example see the file ../or-pat.mlb:

  $(SML_LIB)/basis/basis.mlb
  ann "allowOrPats true" in
    successor-ml/or-pats.sml
  end

This allows us to test these features while using the same test command for
all test files.
